# stationery-requisition-system
ASP.NET MVC

The team has been tasked to create a stationery inventory system that aims to reduce the
amount of manual work needed and to increase the efficiency in which stationery is disbursed to
the University Departments.

In turn, this will allow stationery store staff more time to attend to other matters instead of being
thoroughly focused on maintaining inventory. The system also aims to reduce communication
breakdown, by providing a series of notifications that are pushed to different respective users to
prompt them for any action required.

We will be covering the entire project SDLC, from gathering user requirement to UAT and
deployment. Stages include:

1. User Requirement Gathering: Including coming up with the sequence diagram, use
cases.
2. UI prototype presentation: This includes the first draft of screens that the team has come
up with to present to the user to get a feel of user sentiment.
3. User acceptance: The team has prepared the system walkthrough that will be gone
through with users.
